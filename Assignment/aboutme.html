            <h1>Why is it important to create your personal portfolio as a CS student?</h1>
            <p>If you are majoring in Computer Science, Web Development is an important skill to acquire that may give you that upper edge in an interview. Viewing how the world is constantly updating in technology it is now becoming a norm to upload our
                resumes on the internet. However how cool would it be to construct your own personal website showcasing who you are?</p>

            <p>The project I aim to completely is creating a portfolio from scratch demonstrating the skills I have and capabilities as a CS major. This became a huge interest for me because seeing I do not have a huge amount of work experience, I can fill
                that void with personal projects. Another reason is one the biggest issue recruiters or anyone that views your online resume can never really catch a glimpse of your personality. In this project, I would like to break that barrier and
                not simply showcasing who I am and what I'm good at, but the hobbies I love doing, the songs I like just small bits sharing who you truly are.</p>
