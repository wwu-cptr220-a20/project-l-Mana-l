                What Is VR Development?
            </h1>
            <p>The concept of VR Development is introducing the ability to encode an artificial reality (hence Virtual Reality). Within the virtual reality, you have a sense of freedom to do whatever comes to mind. Do you want to be exploring the Amazon
                Jungle by yourself? You can! Or want to feel like how it feels to be yelled at by Gordan Ramsy in Hell's Kitchen? Well, I don't want to ask why you want to do that but heck that's possible too! The concept is that we have a device to simulate
                our world or anything we want it to be. Lets put it another way to have it concise and coherent.
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li><b>Interactive</b>: Whenever you go the VR world follows with you. You can invest in watch movies 3D as you would in your local theaters, or reach beyond the stars.</li>
                <li><b>Convincing</b>: Placing one of these devices on your head makes you feel in your this fictional world to a point the illusions of this false reality dissipates.</li>
                <li><b>Computer-Graphics</b>: Who cares are computer graphics!? Well with the powerful machines compacted into these devices is what makes it possible for you to have this sense of realism.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 id=" Potential ">The Potential of VR Development</h2>
            <p>
                The future of VR Development will continue to grow in popularity throughout the world. Please do not mistake yourself that the reason is VR is a tremendous hit for gamers. Surprising VR Development as taken the position in helping architectures design
                layouts of homes, chemists perform reactions, weather simulations, and pretty much anything you can think of. Think about it, the ability to simulate a fake reality and do whatever you want with it leaves us to explore options that were
                not possible before. We can implement physics, real-time interaction, and AI where we can test a situation to an agreeable answer. For example, the amount of fuel a rocket made need to take a full crate of supplies to space. The idea of
                having a VR representation of our world is we can now calculate situations or experience, perhaps casualties, and prevent them from happening in real life. Yet is their more we can accomplish? So far we were able to achieve in convincing
                ourselves in that we are part of another dimension when using the device, but we still do not physically feel the environment. Do you see it possible in a few years we will have a full-body suit next or perhaps a helmet sucking in our
                conscious like it was done in the movie Avatar by James Cameron? In my opinion, I see something around these two becomings very realistic in the near future.
            </p>
            <h2 id="Examples ">Examples of VR Displaying Itself Throughout the Community</h2>
            <p>A few examples where you may see VR within your community is perhaps the gaming industry. Seeing how people love being in a fictional world where they feel in control, numerous developers constructed their projects showing this feature. One,
                for example, is a video from a well-known game developer who goes by the internet name Dani. He created a basic game wherein you are in complete control of civilization. You can either toss them around, eat them, whatever you desire. Unlike
                others, they try to simulate physics and bring a sense of a real-life application. One example is pilots wishing to feel what it is like to fly various planes that otherwise may be impossible to obtain. </p>

            <h2 id="Purchase ">Where Can I Buy One?</h2>
            <p>I am glad you have asked. If you are seeking to get something worth your money, I highly recommend obtaining an Oculus Quest. You do not need to worry about tripping over wires or connecting it to some PC. It's highly affordable where are
                matches in buying a typical console from Sony or Microsoft. The first place I recommend buying from is Amazon, usually, they have the lowest prices on the device where you can save some extra dollars. But if not you might need to buy it
                from Walmart, BestBuy, etc...</p>
