        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p class="text-left">I am a second-year Computer Science undergraduate student at Walla Walla University with an interest in AI and game development and as a software developer. Currently, I had learned how to utilizing Unreal Engine 4 and am eager to start branching
            out on working related projects upon graduation. </p>

        <h1>More About Me</h1>
        <h2>Where do you live?</h2>
        <p class="text-left">I live in San Jose, Calfornia, as it is my hometown. However, during the session of school, I am two states away from my home being Walla Walla University. I would say Washington is a lot greener than the area I grew in, but I guess that's the
            effect of living in the city. </p>

        <h2>Why did you major in computer science?</h2>
        <p class="text-left">One of the biggest reasons I wanted to major in computer science was the freedom you have in creating anything you want. I was overwhelmingly fascinated with technology when I started playing games with friends and watching how YouTubers are creating
            crazy-looking robots in their backyard. Simply put I was so interested in how people were programming these machines, I decided to take initiative and start learning on my own. From there, I slowly worked myself up in understanding how to
            program in different languages and ended up trying to obtain a bachelor of science in computer science.</p>

        <h2>What are your hobbies?</h2>
        <p class="text-left">One of my favorite hobbies I like doing is playing badminton. I love the gameplay, footwork, and overall the communication needed to win a match against your opponent. I believe one of the main reasons why I love the sport so much is the amount
            of time I spent playing it during highschool. Furthermore, another hobby I wished I had more time doing was painting miniatures. I have a good collection of different pieces on different games, but never had the time to sit down and assembly
            them. </p>

        <h2>Whats your biggest fear?</h2>
        <p class="text-left">One of my biggest fears is scuba diving. I completely do not like being in the middle of the ocean where you are thousands of feet away from the surface. Anything can go wrong and just thinking about it gives me the goosebumps. Don't get me wrong,
            I do want to experience seeing the marine life, but if I ever do go you may see me bringing two spare oxygen tanks as insurance. </p>

        <h2>Whats your favorite movie?</h2>
        <p class="text-left">Hands down it has to be any of the Avengers Movies. Especially Iron Man, not only does he look eye-catching in the suit but just imaging how much code would have required to bring that suit to reality. It is often cool to fascinate myself being
            able to create my own independent AI, but I would say it is not entirely impossible. </p>
